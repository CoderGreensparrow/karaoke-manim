# karaoke-manim
Generate karaoke videos with Manim.

NOTE: This program doesn't use illegal downloading methods to get music or video content. The user has to provide all information, including karaoke data.

## File formats

The supported file format is:
- [`.lrc`, short for LyRiCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)#) is a pretty suitable file format for karaoke. This program supports the [A2 extension: word time tag (as it's called on Wikipedia, although it may be "Enhanced LRC"?)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)#A2_extension:_word_time_tag). However, even if the given file is in the [Simple format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)), it can still match the lines without any word highlighting. (It's less like karaoke that way, but better than nothing.)
